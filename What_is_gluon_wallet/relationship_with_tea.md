For end users, they only need to install the Gluon mobile app and a Polkadot browser extension. For the miners, they will need to add Gluon wasm actor into the TEA node. 

Every TEA node can become a hardware wallet when have the Gluon wasm actor installed. 

End users can be miners as well. At least, end users can own their own TEA nodes as the entry point of TEA network. All their transactions will be sent to their own TEA node to get a higher level of security as well as lower the cost.
